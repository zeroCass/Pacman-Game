 # Game Mechanics
 Like the original one, this pacman version has 3 lives and the player win at eating all pill of the map. If the player lose his 3 lives, game over!
 The ghosts has two states:
 1 - The ghost will move randomly in the map
 2 - The gost will chase the player
 If the pacman eats a superpill, all the ghosts become eatable and the player recieve extra points for each ghost eaten.
 

 
#Game Engine 
 We build a game engine only for this project. So the game was made entire based on this game engine.
 The engine handle the collision detection, the movment of all objcts, the draw and update of game.
 So, the game is not optimized.
 
 #The map
 The map is a array of a lot images, so was though to do it, but for sure, exists a better and simply way to make it
